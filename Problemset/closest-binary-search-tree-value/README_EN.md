# [270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value/)

## Description

<p>Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Given target value is a floating point.</li>
	<li>You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286
